# Continuous Delivery of Flask Application with Google Cloud Platform

Creating a Google Continuous Delivery application in the Google Cloud Engine

Created repository for the Google Cloud app on GitHub connected with the SSH key to Google cloud and added the key to the project.
Once the key was set-up then created all the files in the folder to add to the Flask application and ran the basic Flask with just the welcome message and the value change and once done with the basics first deployed the app and connected to GitHub.

Once the deployment and intergration was done, then I updated the Flask routes to run the pandas and the Wikipedia page. The NLP application took a while to understand but with the creation of a key with credentials worked to show the entities of the results from the wikipedia page.

Here is the video of the application running,
